### Comments:

 I made a simple clone of [swapi]https://swapi.co/api/ with the propose of put in practice my knowledges of Express, NodeJS and Postgresql. I used some Functional Programming approaches like Memoization and function composition. the app could be improved and add more functionalities and those stuffs. Maybe in the future :)
