### Comments:

 I made a simple clone of [swapi](https://swapi.co/api/) with the propose of put in practice my knowledges of Express, NodeJS, Knex, SQL and Postgres. I used some Functional Programming approaches like Memoization and function composition mixed with some MVC and OOP to keep the global design organized. The propose was really play a bit with knex and typescript. When the project is finished I will post it in my portfolio.
 The app has some Email api_key validation process 
 I tried to make the things as Vanila as possible without any ORM.
