### Comments:

 I made a simple clone of [swapi](https://swapi.co/api/) as a personal challenge and with the propose of put in practice my knowledges of Express, NodeJS, Knex, SQL and Postgres. I used some Functional Programming approaches like Memoization and function composition mixed with some MVC and OOP to keep the global design organized. The propose was really play around a bit with knex, typescript, postgres etc. 
 The app has some Email api key validation process and authentication process through api key. 
 Is not the securest way but is fine for the propose of this app.
