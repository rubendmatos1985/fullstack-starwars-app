### Comments:

 I made a simple clone of [swapi](https://swapi.co/api/) with the propose of put in practice my knowledges of Express, NodeJS, Knex and Postgresql. I used some Functional Programming approaches like Memoization and function composition mixed with some MVC to keep the gloabal design organized. The propose was really play a bit with knex and typescript.  
 
 The app could be improved and add more functionalities and those stuff. Maybe in the future :)
